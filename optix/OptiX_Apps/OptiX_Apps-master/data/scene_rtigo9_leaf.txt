# ========== CAMERA

# Lens shader callable program.
# 0 = pinhole
# 1 = full format fisheye
# 2 = spherical projection

lensShader 0

# Camera center of interest.
# Absolute x, y, z coordinates in scene units (meters)

center 0 0 0

# Camera orientation relative to center of interest and projection
# phi   [0.0f, 1.0f] # 0.75 is positive z-axis
# theta [0.0f, 1.0f] # 0 is south pole, 0.5 is equator, 1.0 is north pole
# yfov in degrees [1, 179]
# distance from center of interest [0.0f, inf] in meters

# ========== TONEMAPPER  

# Usual tonemapper settings:
gamma 2.2
colorBalance 1 1 1
whitePoint 1
burnHighlights 0.8
crushBlacks 0.2
saturation 1.2
brightness 1

# ========== MATERIALS

# Default material. The special material name "default" is used if the referenced material name is not found.

# LIGHT MATERIALS

# Constant environment or spherical textured environment light material.
# If the emissionTexture is specified it's the importance sampled spherical environment.
# The emission and emission multiplier modulate the emission texture values.
# Means standard LDR textures can be used and made brighter by using emissionMultiplier > 1.0

# SURFACE MATERIALS

# The ASSIMP loader returns "DefaultMaterial" as material name for OBJ files with no MTL file.

# ========== ENVIRONMENT LIGHTS

# IMPORTANT: The one environment light inside the scene must always be defined as first light!
# Environment lights are hardcoded to light definition index 0 inside the renderer.
# Not defining an environment light will result in a black environment.

# The transformations are taken from the current state, means the spherical environment texture can be rotated arbitrarily here.
