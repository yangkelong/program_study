# Example of loading an OBJ model file format and instancing all individual geometries (not the model) inside the model using the current stack incrementally.
# This cow.obj model has only one mesh though.

# The ASSIMP loader uses the name "DefaultMaterial" for OBJ models without MTL.
# The albedo is read from the diffuse color in the assimp representation, which is grey 0.8 for an OBJ model without MTL.
