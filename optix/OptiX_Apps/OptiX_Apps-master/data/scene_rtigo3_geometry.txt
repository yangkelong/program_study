# The default color is white for all BSDFs, but all parameters can be changed inside the GUI, 
# though not saved, just via screenshot with "P" for tonemapped *.png or "H" for linear *.hdr 

# When loading a model via "model assimp" the loader will use the model's diffuse color when present for the albedo parameter to have some variation.

# Each "material" definition will generate a material parameter set to edit inside the GUI. (Including unused ones.)

# The "default" material is a special case and used if there is no material found for a local material name. 
# It's recommended to always have this defined!
# It's also used when for example OBJ models do not have an accompanying MTL file.

material default brdf_diffuse

# For all other materials, if the local name (first argument after "material" keyword) matches the material name inside a model, then that material is used.
# The local material name handles strings in quotation marks to support names with spaces.
